# Stock Price Predictor using Linear Regression Model

This project implements a stock price predictor using the Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn (sklearn) library in Python.  It demonstrates a basic application of machine learning to financial data.  **Important:** Please be aware that stock price prediction is inherently complex and influenced by many factors.  This model is a simplified example and should not be used for actual investment decisions without further research and understanding.  **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simple and understandable example of using linear regression to predict stock prices.  Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between a dependent variable (stock price) and one or more independent variables (e.g., previous day's price, volume, etc.) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Features

*   **Linear Regression Model:** Uses `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` for prediction.
*   **Data Loading:** Reads historical stock data from a CSV file.
*   **Feature Engineering (Basic):** Demonstrates basic feature creation (e.g., using lagged values).
*   **Prediction:** Predicts future stock prices based on the trained model.
*   **Evaluation:** Provides basic evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error).  *(Note: Implement evaluation if you have validation data and corresponding evaluation code)*
*   **Visualization:**  Offers basic visualization of the actual vs. predicted prices. *(Note: Implement visualization if you have visualization code)*

## Dependencies

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   scikit-learn (sklearn)
*   pandas
*   numpy
*   matplotlib (Optional, for visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:


## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Vishwathma2004/stock_price_predictor.git
    cd stock-price-predictor
    ```

2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies (if you haven't already):

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt  #If you have a requirements.txt file
    # OR
    pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib # If you don't have a requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your data:** Place your historical stock data in a CSV file (e.g., `stock_data.csv`).  The CSV should at least contain a column representing the date and a column representing the closing price.

2.  **Modify the script:**
    *   Update the `data_file` variable in the Python script (`main.py` or similar) to point to your CSV file.
    *   Adjust the feature engineering section to create features relevant to your data.  The example likely uses lagged prices, but you can add other indicators.
    *   Modify the `target_column` variable to specify the name of the column containing the closing price.

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```
    python main.py  # Or the name of your Python script
    ```

4.  **Interpret the output:** The script will output the predicted stock prices.  *(If you have implemented it, it will show also visualization and evaluation of the model.)*

## Data Source

Specify the source of the data used for training the model. Examples:

*   Yahoo Finance
*   Alpha Vantage
*   IEX Cloud
*   Your own custom data source

Include specific details on how to access the data and any required API keys or registration.  For example: "Historical stock data was downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library."

## Model Explanation

This project uses Linear Regression to model the relationship between features (e.g., previous day's closing price) and the target variable (current day's closing price). The model learns a linear equation that best fits the training data.  The equation takes the form:

`Price(t) = b0 + b1 * Price(t-1) + b2 * Volume(t-1) + ...`

where:

*   `Price(t)` is the predicted price at time *t*
*   `b0` is the intercept
*   `b1`, `b2`, ... are the coefficients for each feature
*   `Price(t-1)` is the price at the previous time step
*   `Volume(t-1)` is the volume at the previous time step

## Limitations

*   **Linearity Assumption:** Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. This assumption may not hold true for stock prices, which can be influenced by complex non-linear factors.
*   **Limited Features:** The example likely uses a limited set of features.  Real-world stock price prediction requires considering a much wider range of factors, including economic indicators, news sentiment, and company-specific information.
*   **Overfitting:** The model may overfit the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.  Techniques like regularization and cross-validation can help mitigate overfitting.  These are not necessarily implemented in the basic example.
*   **Market Volatility:** Stock markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable. No model can perfectly predict future prices.
*   **Simplified Model:** This project is a simplified demonstration and should not be used for actual investment decisions.
